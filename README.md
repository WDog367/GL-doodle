# GL-doodle
Repo for jiggering with OpenGL and related.

Some of the projects have dependcies on:

- [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
- [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [tinyxml2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/)
- [glfw3](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)


Recently rejiggered to use CMake to generate build files (the code is still bad, though).
If you have these dependcies compiled and installed properly CMake should be able to find them and link them in.
