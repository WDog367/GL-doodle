# GL-doodle
Basic OpenGL testing and experimenting

using:  
        freeglut: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
        glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/
        glm: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogl-math/
        
        (I'm pretty sure those links are good)

I'm not sure how well it works when you download .sln files, but I have it them set up to look in c:\MSVC for the extracted libraries and headers, so put them there, and it might work?

also, make sure you but the glew and glut .dll's in the folder with the compiled application for it to work
